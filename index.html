      <h2>Activity</h2>
      <p>I took H2 Computing as I have an interest in it. I started my computing journey in 2019 December holidays when I was still a primary 6 student. During that holiday, I learnt the computing language C++. After entering Secondary School, I worked with ardunios in ICT lessons in secondary 1 and 2. My interest for computing continued into upper secondary and I chose computing as an O level subject when I was given the chance to choose my subject combination. During my time taking Computing as an O level subject, I have taken part in competitions such as Autralian Informatics Olympiad and Perse Coding Team Challenge and achieved Bronze and Merit award respectively. Hence, I chose to continue my computing journey in Anderson Serangoon Junior College by taking H2 Computing. I hope that I will be able to participate in competitions in the future and possibly win some awards.</p>
